# WillowTree Apps Namegame

Welcome to my version of WillowTree's Namegame!

This was primarily written in AngularJS, with heavy usage of NgMaterial.

## Features

In brief - The goal of the game is to match the name to the correct face. A few additional tweaks were made to make it more interesting.

1. 3 game modes - Free play, Timed, Mat(t) (only display faces & names that start with Mat).
2. Hints - Need help? flip the hint switch and let the game make it easier on ya.
3. Keyboard shortcuts - arrow keys, numbers, enter, and vim shortcuts (l,j,h,k,0) all work for your face matching needs.
4. Overview tab - details explaining the game.
5. Review tab - Frustrated with the last few rounds? Review it!
6. Stats tab - Lets see just how great(terrible) you are at remembering your co-workers.


## Frustrations

Unfortunately, this project was timed and to avoid going severely over the limit, several features were scrapped, a few UX bugs were introduced(what??? no....), and html was left in a rougher state than I like. However, I'm happy with the outcome given the parameters and the time allotted. There are several(many) things I would change given the opportunity.


## Lets start this rocket

1. download & install [node.js](https://www.nestrealty.com/charlottesville/listings/3300_middle_mountain_rd/567838.html)
2. install http-server
    npm install http-server -g
3. download or check out the [game](https://github.com/dlustig/willowtree-namegame.git)
4. in terminal or cmd 
    http-server "[path to game]"
5. navigate to the [server](http://localhost:8080)

Enjoy! and don't judge too heavily :)
